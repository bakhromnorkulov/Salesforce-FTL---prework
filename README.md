## Required Functionality
- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

Despite I knew basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I had to use additional resources which were so useful. In order to understand the logic and implement more functions, I utilized w3schools. The instructions for the project were clear and helped me alot to complete it successfully. 

https://www.w3schools.com/ 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

First of all, once I began watching tutorials, I didn't realize the logic of the game. After having completed the project and tested it, I was completely sure how it works and the way I can add more functions and features to make more challenging. As I mentioned above that I did have less knowledge and experience, the process of understanding the source code in JavaScript was quite tough. Because, I have tried several small projects in HTML and CSS. Anyway, as always Google and YouTube were the key solutions to this problem. Actually, it took roughly 6 hours to complete and submit the project without any interruptions. Another difficulty that I faced was exporting my files from Glitch to GitHub. I did, however when I opened repository, it automatically transferred unneccesary files. So, I only left READ.me file and source codes. After all, the huge issue in which I become more in stress was the link of the recorded gif. To be precise, I recorded the gif using LICEcap, then I was stuck by finding the link of the gif and edit it in READ.me file. To my surprise, one of my friends who have already submitted pre-work have more concrete instructions how to get the link of a gif. After dedicated effort and by exploring more websites to make things understandable, I did it :)

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I had troubles to understand the concepts used in the tutorials in JavaScript precisely: Global Variables (pattern, progress, gamePlaying) as well as in Playing Clue especially sequence of clues (playClueSequence). It took time and more focus to get to the depth and realize them. I am grateful that I learned how to create repositories, commit, push in GitHub by real-time practice on this project. It was my first time using GitHub more wisely. Previously, I have created 2 repositories, but they were simple projects. Eventually, I understood how hard it is to make multiple paged responsive website and debug them. It takes knowledge, more importantly hands-on experience to make all things work. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had more time, tell the truth if I started doing the pre-work earlier, I would add more features to make it more orinal and challenging. To be clearly, I'd add more than 4 functional game buttons which would make the game more difficult. In addition, I would definitely take a chance to make Playback speeds up on each turn that requires strong focus for the player to win. As I mentioned above, I spent approximately a bit more than 6 hours to complete the pre-work. Anyway, the app worked smoothly without any bugs, that makes sense.
